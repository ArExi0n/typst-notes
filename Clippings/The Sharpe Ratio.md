### Intro

**0:00** · hey guys welcome to this video in this video we're going to be talking about the sharp ratio the sharp ratio is a really simple metric it's just a ratio but what we'll see is is it is at the same time really deep and really useful sharp ratios are definitely the number one metric used by quants on Wall Street

**0:16** · and just by trying to talk about the sharp ratio just trying to even introduce it we'll be forced to touch on many of the key Topics in Quad research and trading we'll talk about portfolio construction diversification correlation leverage hedging and risk so so if you're interested in Quant Finance this is a great place to get started now to motivate the shart ratio we're going to first have to talk about why investing is not only about returns why it can't

### Why investing is not only about returns

**0:40** · just be about percent returns which might be counterintuitive in order to illustrate this point we're going to start with an example here are two Investments green and black they both returned exactly the same amount they both returned 40% the question is which is better now in order to answer this obviously we can't just look at percent returns because they're the same between the two so we have to look at something that's different one thing that's different between the two is the path that each took to reach that 40% if you look at green the path is pretty steady

**1:08** · in comparison black Wiggles around and moves around a lot more right and in particular has this steep up and down right in the middle here you probably already intuitively know that these Wiggles that black has are bad here are a few reasons why the first reason The Wiggles are bad is that it makes black a lot more painful to hold sure sometimes

**1:28** · it is beating Green right but other times it underperforms by a lot and in particular it would be incredibly scary to be all the way down here not knowing if and when you'll ever recover your investment from basic trading psychology we know that these losses are going to loom larger than any gains and make the

**1:47** · holding experience a lot more painful for black the second reason The Wiggles are bad is it gives us less confidence in Black going forward which makes us not really want to invest in it right after wiggling around so much doesn't it seem like black could really do anything whereas green seems like it would make steady gains the third reason The Wiggles are bad is because of liquidity

**2:10** · liquidity what happens if we suddenly needed cash black Wiggles around so much that we could be down when we need the money and we would be forced to close the position at a loss by now many will recognize that The Wiggles here actually represents risk and we can answer our

**2:27** · initial question a lot more directly black is a worse investment than green despite having returned the same because it took on a lot more risk to get that return we need a performance metric that reflects this because simple percentage returns clearly fails the first thing we have to do in order to derive this new metric is to quantify risk our risk metric should capture this intuition that if the returns graph Wiggles a lot like black there's a lot more uncertainty pain or luck involved and therefore uh it's a riskier investment

### Quantifying risk with volatility

**2:57** · one of the simplest and most common ways of doing this is by calculating the standard deviation returns also known as volatility denoted by Sigma the formula for volatility is given here uh in words it's it computes the average of the square deviations from the mean return

**3:16** · that's quite a mouthful I think it's a lot easier to understand volatility visually the graph here represents the average return in the formula or average by this orange trend line and it represents the RT in the formula by uh

**3:32** · the blue curve which is the actual investment of course but volatility measures is deviations from this trend line represented by these red arrows in other words it's precisely trying to measure the Wiggles in the graph that we want to capture all right now that we have our risk metric we're ready to introduce the sharp ratio which is a risk adjusted measure performance the

### Sharpe ratio formula

**3:57** · sharp ratio can be calculated pretty simply by taking your average daily returns putting that in the numerator and dividing that by your Vault so um when we just look at this formula it it makes a lot of sense the higher your average returns are the higher the sharp will be which is exactly what we want but also it's penalized in the denominator by volatility so the higher your risk more Wiggles there are in your graph the lower your sharp will be which is exactly what we want now one detail I

**4:26** · left out here is that typically we multiply this in practice by a factor of 252 and that's because that will annualize the sharp ratio and and that will annualize the sharp ratio and typically just to keep things Apples to Apples we look at things on an annual time frame uh the factor of 252 we won't derive it here but it comes about because we're using daily data and there

**4:52** · are 252 trading days in a calendar year excluding weekends and holidays if you're using monthly data you would have a square of 12 here instead because there are 12 months in a year so does the Shar ratio actually work in other words is it able to identify that green is the better investment when returns could not coming back to our original graph we calculated the sharp of green versus black as two versus 1/2 so yes

### Does the Sharpe ratio "work"?

**5:18** · the sharp works it reflects this intuition that we have that green is the better investment well returns alone would say the two are the same it does this by incorporating volatility to tell you how much return you actually earn per unit of risk you took to get an even better sense of what the sharp ratio is measuring we've plotted hypothetical Investments with increasing Sharps here 2 five and 20 Sharps as the sharps

**5:41** · increase the Wiggles in the curve get smaller at a 20 sharp you basically have a straight line going up and to the right a 20 sharp would be extremely difficult to capture at scale and represents a near perfect Arbitrage so if a 20 sharp is a bit unrealistic what's an actual realistic good Sharp ratio well the trailing 20-year sharp of the S&amp;P 500 as measured by spy an ETF

### What's a good Sharpe ratio?

**6:06** · that tracks the S&amp;P 500 is around 0.45 Warren Buffett one of the most famous investors in the world has been able to beat the market for a long time and has a sharp ratio of around 0.75 good hedge funds however have sharps in the 2 plus range and that should really be our goal so we've seen

### Diversification and hedging

**6:27** · that sharps are useful for evaluating St and alone Investments however just as importantly they let you evaluate combinations of investment here's a quick stylized example to illustrate this point red and blue here are both equal sharp Investments they both have a sharp ratio of 2.0 they also have the

**6:46** · same volatility and return so which of these should we go with maybe we're indiff since they have the same return and sharp so we'll just flip a coin heads go with red and tails with blue but actually there is a best investment that can be carefully chosen here it can be found by observing that when red zigs blue zags and vice versa in other words

**7:10** · their Wiggles are opposite they are negatively correlated so if we combine the two Investments couldn't we cancel The Wiggles reduce risk and obtain a higher sharp portfolio with a smoother return profile in this graph per does does exactly this it's a 50/50 portfolio of

**7:33** · red and blue it looks a lot smoother right indeed while the sharp of red and blue were each two per has a gigantic sharp ratio of five and this is all while maintaining the same solid return if we had only looked at returns as a performance metric we wouldn't even be able to tell that perp is any better than red or blue and the concept of creating per as a better investment would never even be on our radar however

**7:59** · when you think in terms of Sharps this becomes too obvious when people say they're trying to diversify diversify or hedge their portfolios this is exactly what they're referring to they're trying to create a smoother return profile or investment by

**8:19** · combining Investments that move in opposing ways and sharp ratios are one way to tell how effectively we've done that with returns you wouldn't even be able to gauge how well you've head or Diversified your portfolio I now want to switch gears and address one of the initial concerns people often have when dealing with sharps in this graph I've plotted two Investments one that has a higher sharp High Sr and one that has a higher return High R which is better

### Would you rather invest in high SR or high returns?

**8:47** · while the smoothness of high Sr is nice in the end we can't eat sharp ratios and we'll have more dollars in our Park pocket investig in the blue line High R so perhaps High R is better does that that somehow make Sharps less meaningful to look at the answer in the large majority of cases is no but to understand this more clearly we have to understand leverage all right guys here is a quick primer on how leverage Works

### How leverage works

**9:12** · Leverage is pretty simply borrowing money to invest more than you own that's it's what you do when you take out a mortgage to invest in a house here's a concrete example that applies to finance let's say you initially have $100 of cash to invest this is what we call your Equity Capital if you then borrow another $100 to invest the total amount you invested is $200 and your Leverage is 2x for every 1% gain in the original

**9:38** · investment the stock that you invested in or you know crypto or whatever you're actually going to earn $2 not $1 you're going to earn $2 because you get a dollar on the cash that you invested your equity and then you get another dollar on the $100 you borrowed right your leverage so you get a 2% return on your actual equity the original $100 that you invested other words dollar p&amp;l swings are doubled and so returns are doubled you earn 2% rather than 1% it's

**10:11** · not too hard to show that VA is volatility or is also doubled and that's because if the investment increases by 1% you get $2 but on the flip side if it decreases by 1% you also lose double or you lose $2 so the key Point here is that leverage amplifies both returns and volatility in a Financial or investment context and so sharp ratios remain constant so if you took 2x leverage you'd have 2X to returns 2x tool but the sharp would remain the same same applies for 3x leverage 4X leverage or whatever

**10:42** · other leverage that you took all right guys so given this result around leverage how do we actually use it this is the key takeaway you can use leverage with high sharp strategies to Target even higher returns while maintaining The Identical sharp right so and this is this is going to be why um in many cases

### Leverage for quant trading

**11:01** · High sharp strategies are better than lower sharp strategies even if the lower sharp strategy had somewhat higher returns because you can simply just like lever up the higher sharp strategy to obtain higher returns and maintain the same high sharp so back to our original question here of whether High r or high

**11:20** · Sr is better given these results around leverage we could just lever up the high sharp this Orange Line the high Sr portfolio to obtain equal or higher returns in the high red portfolio while maintaining that same nice high sharp the graph shows High Sr the original orange line levered up to 2X and 3X

**11:42** · leverage as you can see we can maintain the smoothness nice smooth return profile of the original orange line um actually the profiles are identical in terms of their Wiggles and at the same time obtain you know the same or even higher returns then then High R the blue line right so you really do get the best of both worlds and to answer our initial question the best investment here is

**12:10** · going to be a likely a leverag version of the highr portfolio leverage it it does bring with it some risks and costs and and users should manage those carefully if you take an excessive amount of Leverage you could potentially blow up and we'll discuss this in another video but for now the key takeaway is that Leverage makes high sharp strategies very powerful even if

**12:32** · they have lower returns initially you can just Target higher returns while maintaining the nice high sharp and smooth return profile all right guys and I just want to briefly touch on some Theory so we've seen that higher sharp equals fewer Wiggles Wiggles isn't exactly a technical term but there are a lot some technical justifications for using the sharp ratio not going to spend too much time on this but I just want to briefly mention a couple um a simple

**12:55** · stat so the first is from statistics the simp a simple stats approach to evaluating a return series I might seek to determine if the returns are statistically greater than zero going back to just stat 101 we can compute a tat for this if you never heard of a tat don't worry it's fine for now it's just just understand that it's a number that tells you how likely it is your investment actually will have a positive

### Statistical justification for the Sharpe ratio

**13:19** · return going forward the interesting thing about tats and Sharps is that it's it's not too hard to show that the tstat is actually you know it's proportional to the sharp ratio right and if you're interested you could actually back this out based on the formula for the tat so here's the formula for the tat here are the uh values for the variables that go into the tstat if you actually plug these values into the formula what you get is this guy and you can see already

**13:49** · in this formula that you basically have the sharp ratio right there and if you just rearrange things what you get is that this tat is equal to this guy and the sharp ratio is right there so the tat is directly proportional to the sharp ratio if you're evaluating multiple Investments sharp ratio is already rank order them by statistical significance and you're just one scaler away from actually getting the full tat

**14:13** · and I think this is perhaps why intuitively we also feel less confident going forward in Investments with more Wiggles and lower Sharps and finally there is an academic justification for the sharp ratio which I'll just briefly mention we don't like getting too academic here but there is some Financial Theory which says that rational investors who like returns but dislike risk as measured by volatility

### Academic justification for the Sharpe ratio

**14:36** · should only hold a single portfolio to maximize their happiness or utility and that portfolio happens to be the highest sharp portfolio which is also known as the tangency portfolio in uh academic Finance so we should always be striving to maximize the sharp ratio of our investments all right guys that wraps it up for Sharp ratios if any of this seemed fast don't worry it was meant to be an introduction to Shar start ratios and we'll go over everything in more detail in other videos here are some key

### Conclusion

**15:03** · takeaways for now returns matter in investing but so does risk start ratios are one way to incorporate risk and to to create a risk adjusted measure of investment performance they can be used to evaluate Standalone Investments but also tell you how well Investments mix together in fact it's impossible to do this using just returns if your high sharp strategy ever doesn't have a high

**15:26** · enough return you can use a Leverage to lever up high sharp strategies to Target higher return and maintain that nice smooth return F return profile finally a solid goal for us should be to achieve a two plus sharp if you can consistently achieve a two plus sharp you'll be doing better than 99% of investors out there all right hope you enjoyed this video and see you next time
